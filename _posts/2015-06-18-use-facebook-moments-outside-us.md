Hi,

You must be aware of **Moments**, an app launched by Facebook which lets you sync your photographs with your friends in an easy way.

But, the service is only available only in **United States** right now.
Google Play Store doesn't list the app for you if you are living outside United States.
But, after the launch of the application, I downloaded the app from <a href="http://www.apkmirror.com/" target="_blank">**APK Mirror**</a>.
I thought it might work in my phone. But, It didn't.
Earlier, the message on the application was saying that I can't use Moments outside United States.
But, this morning I again opened the application and received a notification.


*"Moments has finished the syncing of your photos for you."*

I was surprised. Moments had started working for me.
Now, I am using Facebook Moments without living in United States here in India.
Please see the screenshot.

Please try downloading moments on your Phone from APK mirror and share your experience if you too are able to use Moments.
I don't know how this is working now.
